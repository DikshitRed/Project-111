sample z test 
if new sample mean lies within 1st standard deviation then not much impact of the intervention
if new sample mean lies within 2nd standard deviation then significant impact of the intervention
if new sample mean lies within 3rd or beyond 3rd standard deviation then high impact of intervention
if the intervention is positive then the mean would lie to the right .
if the intervention is negative then the mean would lie to the left 

z = (mean - mean of sample1)/ standard deviation 

z = (mean - mean of sample2)/ standard deviation

z = (mean - mean of sample3)/ standard deviation

if the z is > than 3 or > than 2 -> sample mean lies more than 3 standard deviation away from (mean that means high impact)
if the z is < 1 or z < 2 -> (impact is not significant)

this type of testing to identify the impact of interventions is used by governments, financial institutions to understand what works the best

z is a mathematical score which tells us how many standard deviations away is the new mean from the sampling population distribution
